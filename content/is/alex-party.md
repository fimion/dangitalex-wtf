Let's talk about.... things!

[Alex.party](https://alex.party) is my blog for tech and miscellaneous other content.
Previously it was done in [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org), but as I wanted to be able to move over to vue 3,
I evaluated my options, and found that [Astro](https://astro.build) was a very exciting new system that would let me use
my already existing vue components and markdown files. I spent a couple of hours moving things over in late
2022, and haven't looked back. A+. Super great times.
