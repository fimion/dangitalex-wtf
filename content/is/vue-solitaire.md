This game was written as a response to 2 issues.

1. I needed a way to demonstrate multiple Vue instances sharing a single global store.
2. I needed an ad-free solitaire game for my phone.

Vue Solitaire ia a perfect example of both of these. there are several areas on the page that 
all communicate the current state via vuex. I have since updated it to vue 3, but I have not yet moved it over to Pinia.
